# AirPods-for-Windows
Adds AirPods support for Windows.

# What does it do?
You know how when you open your AirPods, and theres a animation on your iPhone or iPad? Well this application adds that exact animation to Windows!

# Future
I am planning to rewrite the entire program. Some planned features I plan to add are:
- Dark theme (Maybe your own custom colors?)
- Custom fonts
- USB Devices support
- Multiple devices (might take a while idk)
- And many more...

All of this, however, will depend on how much free time I have. Hopefully I can knock out half of those features before Feburary.

# Done features
0.3 Release date: Sometime this month. Yes I said during January but like school sucks so sorry bout that. The project is done and compiled and I can release it now but I need some testers first. Contact me if you want to test it in the next 24hrs. After that I might or might not release idk it depends.

## Changelog
- Configurator to change settings
- A better setup (A .msi setup)
- Ability to change the paired bluetooth device easily
- Customizable UI:
  - Change animation to your own video or a image or a music file or whatever MediaElement/Image supports
  - Custom "Done" button text
  - Ability to have a static name (so it doesn't default to your devices name)
 - Create your own templates using a .json file
- Project renamed to Apple Bluetooth UI

### Notes
It's currently 2/25/2020 and its 10:06pm where I live and I have school tomorrow. If I can somehow extract the animations for AirPods Gen2 and Pro, Beats, and other headphones it might be supported on release instead of you know... a later version. Let's just see how this goes. After release I will add a section to this readme to show how to create a custom template for this program.
