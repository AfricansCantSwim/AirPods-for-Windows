# What does it do?
You know how when you open your AirPods, and theres a animation on your iPhone or iPad? Well this application adds that exact animation to Windows!

# Future
I am planning to rewrite the entire program. Some planned features I plan to add are:
- Dark theme (Maybe your own custom colors?)
- Custom fonts
- USB Devices support
- Multiple devices (might take a while idk)
- And many more...
