# AirPods-for-Windows
Adds AirPods support for Windows.

# What does it do?
You know how when you open your AirPods, and theres a animation on your iPhone or iPad? Well this application adds that exact animation to Windows!

# Future
I am planning to rewrite the entire program. Some planned features I plan to add are:
- Gen 2 and Pro support.
- Beats and other headphones support.
- Dark theme (Maybe your own custom colors?)
- A better setup
- Custom fonts
- USB Devices support
- Multiple devices (might take a while idk)
- And many more...

All of this, however, will depend on how much free time I have. Hopefully I can knock out half of those features before Feburary.

# Done features
0.3 Release date: 1/23/2020 (maybe earlier hopefully? Maybe later? Hopefully it releases before Feb.)

## Changelog
- Configurator to change settings
- A better setup (A .msi setup)
- Ability to repair bluetooth device
- Customizable UI:
  - Change animation to your own video or a image or a music file or whatever MediaElemnt supports
  - Custom "Done" button text
  - Ability to have a static name (so it doesn't default to you devices name)
 - Create your own templates using a .json file
- Project renamed to Apple Bluetooth UI

### Notes
2/13/20 - A jailbreak for A13 is coming soon so that means i will be able to natively support gen 2 airpods and stuff so just wait a week at max hopefully

AirPods Generation 2, Beats, etc are currently still not supported as I need access to a jailbroken device to extract the animations from the FS, so once Checkra1n comes out for linux, I will update it, however you can add your own support for these devices by creating your template, instructions will be included later.
