# What does it do?
You know how when you open your AirPods, and theres a animation on your iPhone or iPad? Well this application recreates that animation to Windows!

## Features
- You are able to add a bluetooth device to the program, everytime you connect a device, the animation will play.
- Change the animation to a picture or another video
- Custom 'Done' text
- Make bluetooth device name in the pop up static instead of changing to the device name
- Custom templates to share with other people (If you want your template featured, PM me on reddit www.reddit.com/u/LavamasterYT or DM me on twitter: @mcgoodfortbad)

# Future
Some planned features I plan to add are:
- Custom fonts
- USB Devices support
- And many more...

## 0.4
The changelog for 0.4 will be:
- Multiple devices support.
- Use of JSON files to store configurations and settings
- Add ability to have custom colors on the prompt.
- Possible rewrite of the code again, maybe just one aspect of it though.

Release date TBA.
