# AirPods-for-Windows
Adds AirPods support for Windows.

# What does it do?
You know how when you open your AirPods, and theres a animation on your iPhone or iPad? Well this application adds that exact animation to Windows!

# Future
I am planning to rewrite the entire program. Some planned features I plan to add are:
- Gen 2 and Pro support.
- Beats and other headphones support.
- Dark theme (Maybe your own custom colors?)
- A better setup
- Misc bluetooth devices
- Ability to add your own custom animation
- Static device name
- Custom "Done" button text
- Custom fonts
- Multiple devices (might take a while idk)
- Of course a configurator for all these features
- And many more...

All of this, however, will depend on how much free time I have. Hopefully I can knock out half of those features before Feburary.
