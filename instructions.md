So you want to create a template for AppleBluetoothUI? Well here are the instructions.

# Tutorial
## Create .JSON file
First, we need to create a .JSON file to store our settings in. Create a .JSON file and add the following values to it:
```json
{
    "templatename": "ok",
    "usingimage": 0,
    "iconlocation": "Templates/Assets/ag1.mp4",
    "statictext": 0,
    "staticname": "AirPods",
    "buttontext": "text"
}
```
Now to test the template, save it and put the template anywhere you want. Next go into the configurator (BluetoothUI.exe) and select the other radio button. Find the file and open it. All the changes are automatically applied. Now click on the "Test UI" button. You should see the button text change. Congrats, you created your first template! Now we will go over and see what each setting does.
